Supybot is a robust (it doesn't crash), user friendly (it's easy to
configure) and programmer friendly (plugins are *extremely* easy to
write) Python IRC bot.  It aims to be an adequate replacement for most
existing IRC bots.  It includes a very flexible and powerful ACL system
for controlling access to commands, as well as more than 50 builtin plugins
providing around 400 actual commands.

Limnoria is a project which continues development of Supybot (you can
call it a fork) by fixing bugs and adding features (see the
[list of added features](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria/wiki/LGC) for
more details).

## Documentation

If this is your first install, there is an [install guide](http://doc.supybot.aperio.fr/en/latest/use/install.html).
You will probably be pointed to it if you ask on IRC how to install Limnoria.

There is much documentation
at [supybot.aperio.fr] and at [Gribble wiki] for your perusal.  Please read it; we took the
time to write it, you should take the time to read it.
