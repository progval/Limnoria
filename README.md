Supybot is a robust (it doesn't crash), user friendly (it's easy to
configure) and programmer friendly (plugins are *extremely* easy to
write) Python IRC bot.  It aims to be an adequate replacement for most
existing IRC bots.  It includes a very flexible and powerful ACL system
for controlling access to commands, as well as more than 50 builtin plugins
providing around 400 actual commands.

Limnoria is a project which continues development of Supybot (you can
call it a fork) by fixing bugs and adding features (see the
[list of added features](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria/wiki/LGC) for
more details).

## Documentation

If this is your first install, there is an [install guide](http://doc.supybot.aperio.fr/en/latest/use/install.html).
You will probably be pointed to it if you ask on IRC how to install Limnoria.

There is extensive documentation at [supybot.aperio.fr] and at [Gribble wiki].
We took the time to write it; you should take the time to read it.

If you have any trouble, feel free to swing by [#supybot and #limnoria](ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697/#supybot,#limnoria) on
[freenode](https://freenode.net/) or [#supybot](ircs://irc.oftc.net:6697/#supybot) at [OFTC](http://oftc.net/) (we have a Limnoria there relaying,
