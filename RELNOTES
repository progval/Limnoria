Version 0.77.2

This is a drop-in replacement for 0.77.1, with one exception.  The
configuration variable formerly known as
"supybot.plugins.Services.password" is now known as
"supybot.plugins.Services.NickServ.password", due to the fact that
there might be different passwords for NickServ and ChanServ (and
ChanServ passwords are per-channel, whereas NickServ passwords are
global).  If you're using the Services plugin, you'll need to make
this change in order to continue identifying with services.

Version 0.77.1

This is a drop-in replacement for 0.77.0 -- no incompatibilities, to
out knowledge.  Simply install over your old installation and restart
your bot :)

Version 0.77.0

Setup.py will automatically remove your old installations for you, no
need to worry about that yourself.

Configuration has been *entirely* redone.  Read the new
GETTING_STARTED document to see how to work with configuration
variables now.  Your old botscripts from earlier versions *will not*
work with the new configuration method.  We'd appreciate it if you'd
rerun the wizard in order for us to find any bugs that remain in it
before we officially declare ourselves Beta.  Note also that because
of the new configuration method, the interface for plugins' configure
function has changed: there are no longer any onStart or afterConnect
arguments, so all configuration should be performed via the registry.

Channel capabilities have been changed; rather than being
#channel.capability, they're now #channel,capability.  It's a bit
uglier, we know, but dots can be valid in channel names, and we
needed the dot for handling plugin.command capabilities.
tools/ircdbConvert.py should update this for you.

The on-disk format of the user/channel databases has changed to be far
more readable.  A conversion utility is included, as mentioned before:
tools/ircdbConvert.py.  Run this with no arguments to see the
directions for using it.

Uh, we were just kidding about the upgrade script in 0.76.0 :)  It'll
be a little while longer.  We do have several little upgrade scripts,
though.

Version 0.76.1

Almost entirely bugfixes, just some minor (and some less minor) bugs
that need to get in before we really start hacking on the next
version.  Should be *entirely* compatible with 0.76.0.

Version 0.76.0

Major bugfix release.  A great number of bugs fixed.  This is the last
release without an upgrade script.

The only hiccup in the upgrade from 0.75.0 should be that you'll need
to update your botscript to reflect the removal of the debug module.
We'd rather you use supybot-wizard to generate a new botscript, of
course, but if you insist on modifying your existing botscript, take a
look at
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/supybot/supybot/src/template.py?r1=1.20&r2=1.21>
to see what you need to do.


Version 0.75.0

Don't forget to reinstall (i.e., run "python setup.py install" as
root).  Sometimes it even does good to remove the old installation;
$PYTHON/site-packages/supybot can be removed with no problems
whatsoever.

You will need to re-run supybot-wizard and generate a new botscript.

The Infobot plugin has been removed from this release; it's not ready
for prime time.  If you're interested in getting it running (i.e., you
want full Infobot compatibility and aren't satisfied with either
MoobotFactoids or Factoids) then swing over to #supybot and we can
discuss the tests.  We simply don't know enough about Infobot to make
sure our Infobot plugin is an exact replica, and need someone's help
with making the changes necessary for that.
