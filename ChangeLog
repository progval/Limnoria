	* Version 0.73.0!

	* Added the News plugin, news handling for channels.
	
	* Changed the initial character of anti capabilities to '-'
	instead of '!'.  '!' can be the initial character in a channel
	name, and so any command using getChannel and accepting a
	capability as its first argument (several in ChannelCommands) will
	have difficulties (the channel then *must* be specified since
	getChannel will consider !capability to be a channel name).  Note
	that this means you'll need to either remove and re-create or edit
	your config files to change ! to - in capabilities.

	* Removed the "cvsup" command; it's been useless since we had a
	global install, and can only serve to confuse.

	* Added a "private" command to MiscCommands to allow users to
	specify that a response should be made in private.

	* Added a "secure" flag to user database records that *requires*
	that one of the user's hostmasks match if the user is to be
	recognized.  This flag may be set with the "setsecure" command.

	* Added a convert command to the Math plugin.  More conversions
	are necessary, if anyone's interested in doing it.  The available
	units are available via the "units" command.

	* Fixed the pydoc command to allow access to standard Python
	modules that are shared libraries rather than pure Python code.

	* Added a "Python" plugin and moved FunCommands.{pydoc,zen} to
	it.

	* Fixed the supybot- scripts to use optparse so they now
	accept many command line options (but most importantly, the --help
	option :))

	* Added a debincoming command to the Debian plugin; it searches
	the available packages at http://incoming.debian.org/

	* Moved the "bug" command from MiscCommands to AdminCommands in 
	order to prevent possible abuse.

	* Changed ChannelDB.seen to default to using nicks; a --user 
	option can be passed to use the old behavior.  Note that this
	means you'll have to update your ChannelDB database; use this
	SQL statement to do so:
	    CREATE TABLE nick_seen (
	    name TEXT UNIQUE ON CONFLICT REPLACE,
	    last_seen TIMESTAMP,
	    last_msg TEXT
	    );
