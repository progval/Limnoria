Read PEP 8 (Guido's Style Guide) and know that we use almost all the same style
guidelines.

Maximum line length is 79 characters.  78 is a safer bet, though.

Identation is 4 spaces per level.  No tabs.

Single quotes are used for all string literals that aren't docstrings.
They're just easier to type.

Triple double quotes (""") are always used for docstrings.

Spaces go around all operators (except around '=' in default arguments to
functions) and after all commas (unless doing so keeps a line within the 79
character limit).

Class names are StudlyCaps.  Method and function names are camelCaps
(StudlyCaps with an initial lowercase letter).  If variable and attribute
names can maintain readability without being camelCaps, then they should be
entirely in lowercase, otherwise they should also use camelCaps.  Plugin names
are StudlyCaps.

Imports should always happen at the top of the module, one import per line
(so if imports need to be added or removed later, it can be done easily).

A blank line should be between all consecutive method declarations in a
class definition.  Two blank lines should be between all consecutive class
definitions in a file.  Comments are even better than blank lines for
separating classes.

Database filenames should generally begin with the name of the plugin and the
extension should be 'db'.  baseplugin.DBHandler does this already.

Whenever creating a file descriptor or socket, keep a reference around and be
sure to close it.  There should be no code like this:
  s = urllib2.urlopen('url').read()
Instead, do this:
  fd = urllib2.urlopen('url')
  s = fd.read()
  fd.close()
This is to be sure the bot doesn't leak file descriptors.

All plugins should include a docstring decsribing what the plugin
does.  This docstring will be returned when the user wants help on a
plugin.

Method docstrings in classes deriving from callbacks.Privmsg should include an
argument list as their first line, and after that a blank line followed by
a longer description of what the command does.  The argument list is used by
the 'help' command, and the longer description is used by the 'morehelp'
command.

Whenever joining more than two strings, use string interpolation, not addition:
  s = x + y + z # Bad.
  s = '%s%s%s' % (x, y, z) # Good.
  s = ''.join(x, y, z) # Best, but not as general.
This has to do with efficiency; the intermediate string x+y is made (and thus
copied) before x+y+z is made, so it's less efficient.

Use the debug module to its fullest; when you need to print some values to
debug, use debug.printf to do so, and leave those print statements in the code
(perhaps commented out) so they can later be re-enabled.  Remember that once
code is buggy, it tends to have more bugs, and you'll probably need those print
statements again.

SQL table names should be all-lowercase and include underscores to separate
words.  This is because SQL itself is case-insensitive.

SQL statements in code should put SQL words in ALL CAPS:
  SELECT quote FROM quotes ORDER BY random() LIMIT 1

All plugins should have test cases written for them.  Even if it
doesn't actually test anything but just subclasses
test.PluginDocumentation, it's good to have the test there so there's
a place to add more tests later (and so we can be sure that all
plugins are adequately documented).
