			<question>

					Why does my bot not recognize me or tell me that I don't
					have the <capability>owner</capability> capability?
				</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
                    Because you're not given it anything to recognize you
                    from!  You'll need to identify with the bot
                    (<botcommand>help identify</botcommand> to see how that
                    works) or add your hostmask to your user record
                    (<botcommand>help addhostmask</botcommand> to see how that
                    works) for it to know that you're you.  You may wish to
                    note that <botcommand>addhostmask</botcommand> can accept
                    a password; rather than identify, you can send the command
                    <botcommand>addhostmask myOwnerUser [hostmask]
                    myOwnerUserPassword</botcommand> and the bot will add your
                    current hostmask to your owner user (of course, you should
                    change <literal>myOwnerUser</literal> and
                    <literal>myOwnerUserPassword</literal> appropriately for
                    your bot).

			<question>
				<para>
					How do I make Supybot op my users?
				</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
                    First, you'll have to make sure that your users register
                    with the bot.  They can do this with the
                    <botcommand>register</botcommand> command.  After they do
                    so, you'll want to add the
                    <capability>#channel,op</capability> capability to their
                    user.  Use the <botcommand>channel
                    addcapability</botcommand> command to do this.  After
                    that, your users should be able to use the
                    <botcommand>op</botcommand> command to get ops.
				</para>
				<para>
                    If you want your users to be auto-opped when they join the
                    channel, you'll need to load the <plugin>Enforcer</plugin>
                    plugin and turn its <registrygroup>autoOp</registrygroup>
                    configuration variable on.  Use the
                    <botcommand>config</botcommand> command to do so.  Here's
                    an example of how to do these steps:

   &lt;jemfinch|lambda&gt; I'm going to make an example session for giving
	   you auto-ops, for our FAQ.
   &lt;dunk1&gt; ah ok ;]
   &lt;jemfinch|lambda&gt; First, I need you to register with supybot, using
	   the "register" command (remember to send it in private).
   &lt;dunk1&gt; done
   &lt;jemfinch|lambda&gt; what name are you registered under?
   &lt;dunk1&gt; dunk1
   &lt;jemfinch|lambda&gt; ok, cool.
   &lt;jemfinch|lambda&gt; @channel addcapability dunk1 op
   &lt;supybot&gt; jemfinch|lambda: The operation succeeded.
   &lt;jemfinch|lambda&gt; now use the "op" command to get ops.
   &lt;dunk1&gt; @op
   &mdash; supybot gives channel operator status to dunk1
   &lt;dunk1&gt; works!
   &lt;dunk1&gt; ;]
   &lt;jemfinch|lambda&gt; @load Enforcer
   &lt;supybot&gt; jemfinch|lambda: The operation succeeded.
   &lt;jemfinch|lambda&gt; @config supybot.plugins.Enforcer.autoOp.#supybot On
   &lt;supybot&gt; jemfinch|lambda: The operation succeeded.
   &lt;jemfinch|lambda&gt; ok, now cycle the channel (part and then rejoin)
   &lt;&ndash; dunk1 (dunker@freebsd.nl) has left #supybot
   &ndash;&gt; dunk1 (dunker@freebsd.nl) has joined #supybot
   &mdash; supybot gives channel operator status to dunk1
   &lt;jemfinch|lambda&gt; cool, thanks :)

			<question>
			   <para>
                   Can users with the <capability>admin</capability>
                   capability change configuration variables?
			   </para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					Currently, no.  Since this is the first release of Supybot
                    that uses the registry, we wanted to stay on the
                    conservative side and require the
                    <capability>owner</capability> capability for changing all
                    non-channel-related configuration variables.  Feel free to
                    make your case to us as to why a certain configuration
                    variable should only require the
                    <capability>admin</capability> capability instead of the
                    <capability>owner</capability> capability, and if we agree
                    with you, we'll change it for the next release.

			<question>
				<para>
					How do I make my Supybot connect to multiple servers?
				</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
                    You'll need to use the <plugin>Relay</plugin> plugin.  As
                    long as you don't call the <botcommand>relay
                    join</botcommand> command, it won't actually do any
                    relaying between channels (even if the bot is on the same
                    channel on different networks).  In order to use the Relay
                    plugin, you'll want to first call the <botcommand>relay
                    start</botcommand> command, followed by the
                    <botcommand>relay connect</botcommand> command.  These
                    commands are (unfortunately) not persistent at this time,
                    so you'll need to give them to the bot anytime you start
                    it up.  We'll probably have this lack of persistence
                    rectified before the next release.

			<question>
				<para>
					Can Supybot do factoids?
				</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					Supybot most certainly can!  In fact, we offer two
					full-fledged factoids-related plugins!
				</para>
				<para>
                    <plugin>Factoids</plugin> (written by
                    <nick>jemfinch</nick>) is Supybot's original
                    factoids-related plugin.  It offers full integration with
                    Supybot's nested commands as well as a complete 1:n key to
                    factoid ratio, with lookup by individual number.
                    <plugin>Factoids</plugin> also uses a channel-specific
                    database instead of a global database, although in the
                    future it will likely be a configuration option whether to
                    use channel-specific or global databases for such plugins.
				</para>
				<para>
                    <plugin>MoobotFactoids</plugin> (written by
                    <nick>Strike</nick>) is much more full-featured, offering
                    users the ability to define factoids in a slightly more
                    user-friendly way, as well as parsing factoids to handle
                    &lt;reply&gt;, &lt;action&gt;, "see", and alternations
                    (defining a factoid "test" as "&lt;reply&gt;(foo|bar|baz)"
                    will make the bot send "foo" or "bar" or "baz" to the
                    channel (without the normal "test is " at the beginning)).
                    If you're accustomed to Moobot's factoids or Blootbot's
                    factoids, then this is the Factoids plugin for you.
                    Unfortunately, due to the more natural definition syntax
                    (required to be compatible with Moobot) you can't define
                    Factoids with nested commands; you'll have to evaluate the
                    command first and then copy the result into your factoid
                    definition.  <plugin>MoobotFactoids</plugin> uses a global
                    database, so the factoids are the same for all channels.
				</para>
				<para>
					In the future, we plan to have a compatibility plugin for
					Infobot, but as of present we've not yet written one.

			<question>
				<para>
					Can I import my Infobot/Blootbot/Moobot factoids into
					Supybot?
				</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
                    As of present, we have no automated way to do so.
                    <nick>Strike</nick> has written a few scripts for
                    importing a Moobot database into
                    <plugin>MoobotFactoids</plugin>, however, so you'll want
                    to talk to him about helping you with that.  We're
                    certainly happy to help you convert such databases; if you
                    can provide us with such a database exported to a flat
                    file, we can probably do the rest of the work to write a
                    script that imports it into a database for one of our
                    factoids-related plugins.

				<para>
					I found a bug, what do I do?
				</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					Submit it on Sourceforge through our Sourceforge project
					page:
					<ulink
					url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=58965&amp;atid=489447">
					http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=58965&amp;atid=489447
					</ulink>.  If Sourceforge happens to be down when you try
					to submit your bug, then post it in the "Supybot Developer
					Discussion" forum at our forums at
					<ulink url="http://forums.supybot.org">
						http://forums.supybot.org/
					</ulink>.  If that doesn't work, email
					<email>supybot-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net</email>.  If
					that doesn't work, email
					<email>jemfinch@supybot.org</email>.  If that doesn't
					work, find yourself some carrier pigeons and &hellip; hah!
					You thought I was serious!
				</para>
				<para>
					Anyway, when you submit your bug, we'll need several
					things.  If the bug involved an uncaught exception, we
					need the traceback (basically the stuff from
					&ldquo;Uncaught exception in &hellip;&rdquo; to the next
					log entry).  We'd also like to see the commands that
					caused the bug, or happened around the time you saw the
					bug.  If the bug involved a database, we'd love to see the
					database.  Remember, it's always worse to send us too much
					information in a bug report than too little.

					Karma doesn't seem to work for me.

				<para>
                    <plugin>Karma</plugin> by default doesn't acknowledge
                    karma updates.  If you check the karma of whatever you
                    increased/decreased, you'll note that your increment or
                    decrement still took place.  If you'd rather
                    <plugin>Karma</plugin> acknowledge karma updates, change
                    the
                    <registrygroup>supybot.plugins.Karma.response</registrygroup>
                    configuration variable to <literal>On</literal>.
