Documentation for the Time plugin for Supybot
=============================================

Purpose

A plugin for time-related functions.

Usage
-----

This plugin allows you to use different time-related functions.

.. _commands-Time:

Commands
--------

.. _command-time-at:

``at [<time string>]``
  Returns the number of seconds since epoch <time string> is. <time string> can be any number of natural formats; just try something and see if it will work. If the <time string> is not given, defaults to now.

.. _command-time-ctime:

``ctime [<seconds since epoch>]``
  Returns the ctime for <seconds since epoch>, or the current ctime if no <seconds since epoch> is given.

.. _command-time-ddate:

``ddate [<year> <month> <day>]``
  Returns a the Discordian date today, or an optional different date.

.. _command-time-elapsed:

``elapsed <seconds>``
  Returns a pretty string that is the amount of time represented by <seconds>.

.. _command-time-seconds:

``seconds [<years>y] [<weeks>w] [<days>d] [<hours>h] [<minutes>m] [<seconds>s]``
  Returns the number of seconds in the number of <years>, <weeks>, <days>, <hours>, <minutes>, and <seconds> given. An example usage is "seconds 2h 30m", which would return 9000, which is '3600*2 + 30*60'. Useful for scheduling events at a given number of seconds in the future.

.. _command-time-time:

``time [<channel>] [<format>] [<seconds since epoch>]``
  Returns the current time in <format> format, or, if <format> is not given, uses the configurable format for the current channel. If no <seconds since epoch> time is given, the current time is used. If <channel> is given without <format>, uses the format for <channel>.

.. _command-time-tztime:

``tztime <region>/<city> (or <region>/<state>/<city>``
  Takes a city and its region, and returns its local time. This command uses the IANA Time Zone Database.

.. _command-time-until:

``until <time string>``
  Returns the number of seconds until <time string>.

.. _conf-Time:
