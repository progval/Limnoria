Commands
--------

.. _command-url-last:

``last [<channel>] [--{from,with,without,near,proto} <value>] [--nolimit]``
  Gives the last URL matching the given criteria. --from is from whom the URL came; --proto is the protocol the URL used; --with is something inside the URL; --without is something that should not be in the URL; --near is something in the same message as the URL. If --nolimit is given, returns all the URLs that are found to just the URL. <channel> is only necessary if the message isn't sent in the channel itself.

``stats [<channel>]``
  Returns the number of URLs in the URL database. <channel> is only required if the message isn't sent in the channel itself.
