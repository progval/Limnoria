"    This plugin allows users to define aliases to commands and combinations\n"
"    of commands (via nesting).\n"
"    This plugin is only kept for backward compatibility, you should use the\n"
"    built-in Aka plugin instead (you can migrate your existing aliases using\n"
"    the 'importaliasdatabase' command.\n"
"\n"
"    To add an alias, ``trout``, which expects a word as an argument::\n"
"\n"
"        <jamessan> @alias add trout \"action slaps $1 with a large trout\"\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"        <jamessan> @trout me\n"
"        * bot slaps me with a large trout\n"
"\n"
"    Add an alias, ``randpercent``, which returns a random percentage value::\n"
"\n"
"        @alias add randpercent \"squish [dice 1d100]%\"\n"
"\n"
"    This requires the ``Filter`` and ``Games`` plugins to be loaded.\n"
"\n"
"    Note that nested commands in an alias should be quoted, or they will only\n"
"    run once when you create the alias, and not each time the alias is\n"
"    called. (In this case, not quoting the nested command would mean that\n"
"    ``@randpercent`` always responds with the same value!)\n"
