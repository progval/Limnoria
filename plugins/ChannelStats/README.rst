Documentation for the ChannelStats plugin for Supybot
=====================================================

Purpose
-------

Silently listens to every message received on a channel and keeps statistics
concerning joins, parts, and various other commands in addition to tracking
statistics about smileys, actions, characters, and words.

Usage
-----

This plugin keeps stats of the channel and returns them with
the command 'channelstats'.

.. _commands-ChannelStats:

Commands
--------

.. _command-channelstats-channelstats:

``channelstats [<channel>]``
  Returns the statistics for <channel>. <channel> is only necessary if the message isn't sent on the channel itself.

.. _command-channelstats-rank:

``rank [<channel>] <stat expression>``
  Returns the ranking of users according to the given stat expression. Valid variables in the stat expression include 'msgs', 'chars', 'words', 'smileys', 'frowns', 'actions', 'joins', 'parts', 'quits', 'kicks', 'kicked', 'topics', and 'modes'. Any simple mathematical expression involving those variables is permitted.

.. _command-channelstats-stats:

``stats [<channel>] [<name>]``
  Returns the statistics for <name> on <channel>. <channel> is only necessary if the message isn't sent on the channel itself. If <name> isn't given, it defaults to the user sending the command.
