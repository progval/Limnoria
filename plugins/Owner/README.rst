Documentation for the Owner plugin for Supybot
==============================================

Purpose
-------

Provides commands useful to the owner of the bot; the commands here require
their caller to have the 'owner' capability.  This plugin is loaded by default.

Usage
-----

Owner-only commands for core Supybot. This is a core Supybot module
that should not be removed!

.. _commands-Owner:

Commands
--------

.. _command-owner-announce:

``announce <text>``
  Sends <text> to all channels the bot is currently on and not lobotomized in.

.. _command-owner-defaultcapability:

``defaultcapability {add|remove} <capability>``
  Adds or removes (according to the first argument) <capability> from the default capabilities given to users (the configuration variable supybot.capabilities stores these).

.. _command-owner-defaultplugin:

``defaultplugin [--remove] <command> [<plugin>]``
  Sets the default plugin for <command> to <plugin>. If --remove is given, removes the current default plugin for <command>. If no plugin is given, returns the current default plugin set for <command>. See also, supybot.commands.defaultPlugins.importantPlugins.

.. _command-owner-disable:

``disable [<plugin>] <command>``
  Disables the command <command> for all users (including the owners). If <plugin> is given, only disables the <command> from <plugin>. If you want to disable a command for most users but not for yourself, set a default capability of -plugin.command or -command (if you want to disable the command in all plugins).

.. _command-owner-enable:

``enable [<plugin>] <command>``
  Enables the command <command> for all users. If <plugin> if given, only enables the <command> from <plugin>. This command is the inverse of disable.

.. _command-owner-flush:

``flush takes no arguments``
  Runs all the periodic flushers in world.flushers. This includes flushing all logs and all configuration changes to disk.

.. _command-owner-ircquote:

``ircquote <string to be sent to the server>``
  Sends the raw string given to the server.

.. _command-owner-load:

``load [--deprecated] <plugin>``
  Loads the plugin <plugin> from any of the directories in conf.supybot.directories.plugins; usually this includes the main installed directory and 'plugins' in the current directory. --deprecated is necessary if you wish to load deprecated plugins.

.. _command-owner-logmark:

``logmark <text>``
  Logs <text> to the global Supybot log at critical priority. Useful for marking logfiles for later searching.

.. _command-owner-quit:

``quit [<text>]``
  Exits the bot with the QUIT message <text>. If <text> is not given, the default quit message (supybot.plugins.Owner.quitMsg) will be used. If there is no default quitMsg set, your nick will be used. The standard substitutions ($version, $nick, etc.) are all handled appropriately.

.. _command-owner-reload:

``reload <plugin>``
  Unloads and subsequently reloads the plugin by name; use the 'list' command to see a list of the currently loaded plugins.

.. _command-owner-reloadlocale:

``reloadlocale takes no argument``
  Reloads the locale of the bot.

.. _command-owner-rename:

``rename <plugin> <command> <new name>``
  Renames <command> in <plugin> to the <new name>.

.. _command-owner-unload:

``unload <plugin>``
  Unloads the callback by name; use the 'list' command to see a list of the currently loaded plugins. Obviously, the Owner plugin can't be unloaded.

.. _command-owner-unrename:

``unrename <plugin>``
  Removes all renames in <plugin>. The plugin will be reloaded after this command is run.

.. _command-owner-upkeep:

``upkeep [<level>]``
  Runs the standard upkeep stuff (flushes and gc.collects()). If given a level, runs that level of upkeep (currently, the only supported level is "high", which causes the bot to flush a lot of caches as well as do normal upkeep stuff).

.. _conf-Owner:

Configuration
-------------

.. _conf-supybot.plugins.Owner.announceFormat:


supybot.plugins.Owner.announceFormat
  This config variable defaults to "Announcement from my owner ($owner): $text", is not network-specific, and is not channel-specific.

  Determines the format of messages sent by the 'announce' command. $owner may be used for the username of the owner calling this command, and $text for the announcement being made.

.. _conf-supybot.plugins.Owner.public:


supybot.plugins.Owner.public
  This config variable defaults to "True", is not network-specific, and is not channel-specific.

  Determines whether this plugin is publicly visible.

.. _conf-supybot.plugins.Owner.quitMsg:


supybot.plugins.Owner.quitMsg
  This config variable defaults to "Limnoria $version", is not network-specific, and is not channel-specific.

  Determines what quit message will be used by default. If the quit command is called without a quit message, this will be used. If this value is empty, the nick of the person giving the quit command will be used. The standard substitutions ($version, $nick, etc.) are all handled appropriately.
