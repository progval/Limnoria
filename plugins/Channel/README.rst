Documentation for the Channel plugin for Supybot
================================================

Purpose
-------

Basic channel management commands.  Many of these commands require their caller
to have the #channel,op capability.  This plugin is loaded by default.

Usage
-----

This plugin provides various commands for channel management, such
as setting modes and channel-wide bans/ignores/capabilities. This is
a core Supybot plugin that should not be removed!

.. _commands-Channel:

Commands
--------

.. _command-channel-alert:

``alert [<channel>] <text>``
  Sends <text> to all the users in <channel> who have the <channel>,op capability.

.. _command-channel-ban.add:

``ban add [<channel>] <nick|hostmask> [<expires>]``
  If you have the #channel,op capability, this will effect a persistent ban from interacting with the bot on the given <hostmask> (or the current hostmask associated with <nick>). Other plugins may enforce this ban by actually banning users with matching hostmasks when they join. <expires> is an optional argument specifying when (in "seconds from now") the ban should expire; if none is given, the ban will never automatically expire. <channel> is only necessary if the message isn't sent in the channel itself.

.. _command-channel-ban.hostmask:

``ban hostmask [<channel>] <banmask>``
  Bans the <banmask> from the <channel>.

.. _command-channel-ban.list:

``ban list [<channel>] [<mask>]``
  If you have the #channel,op capability, this will show you the current persistent bans on the <channel> that match the given mask, if any (returns all of them otherwise). Note that you can use * as a wildcard on masks and \* to match actual * in masks

.. _command-channel-ban.remove:

``ban remove [<channel>] <hostmask>``
  If you have the #channel,op capability, this will remove the persistent ban on <hostmask>. <channel> is only necessary if the message isn't sent in the channel itself.

.. _command-channel-capability.add:

``capability add [<channel>] <nick|username> <capability> [<capability> ...]``

.. _command-channel-capability.unset:

``capability unset [<channel>] <capability> [<capability> ...]``

.. _command-channel-cycle:

``cycle [<channel>] [<reason>]``

Configuration
-------------

.. _conf-supybot.plugins.Channel.alwaysRejoin:


supybot.plugins.Channel.alwaysRejoin
  This config variable defaults to "True", is network-specific, and is channel-specific.

  Determines whether the bot will always try to rejoin a channel whenever it's kicked from the channel.

.. _conf-supybot.plugins.Channel.nicksInPrivate:


supybot.plugins.Channel.nicksInPrivate
  This config variable defaults to "True", is network-specific, and is channel-specific.

  Determines whether the output of 'nicks' will be sent in private. This prevents mass-highlights of a channel's users, accidental or on purpose.

.. _conf-supybot.plugins.Channel.partMsg:


supybot.plugins.Channel.partMsg
  This config variable defaults to "Limnoria $version", is network-specific, and is channel-specific.

  Determines what part message should be used by default. If the part command is called without a part message, this will be used. If this value is empty, then no part message will be used (they are optional in the IRC protocol). The standard substitutions ($version, $nick, etc.) are all handled appropriately.

.. _conf-supybot.plugins.Channel.public:


supybot.plugins.Channel.public
  This config variable defaults to "True", is not network-specific, and is not channel-specific.

  Determines whether this plugin is publicly visible.

.. _conf-supybot.plugins.Channel.rejoinDelay:


supybot.plugins.Channel.rejoinDelay
  This config variable defaults to "0", is network-specific, and is channel-specific.

  Determines how many seconds the bot will wait before rejoining a channel if kicked and supybot.plugins.Channel.alwaysRejoin is on.
