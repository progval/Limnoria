This plugin keeps factoids in your bot.

To add factoid say
`@something is something` And when you call `@something` the bot says 
`something is something`.

If you want factoid to be in different format say (for example):
`@Hi is <reply> Hello` And when you call `@hi` the bot says `Hello.`

If you want the bot to use /mes with Factoids, that is possible too.
`@test is <action> tests.` and everytime when someone calls for `test` the bot answers `* bot tests.`
