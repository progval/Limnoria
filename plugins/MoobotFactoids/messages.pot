"    An alternative to the Factoids plugin, this plugin keeps factoids in\n"

"\n"
"    To add factoid say\n"
"    ``@something is something`` And when you call ``@something`` the bot says\n"
"    ``something is something``.\n"
"\n"
"    If you want the factoid to be in different format say (for example):\n"
"    ``@Hi is <reply> Hello`` And when you call ``@hi`` the bot says ``Hello.``\n"

"    If you want the bot to use /mes with Factoids, that is possible too.\n"
"    ``@test is <action> tests.`` and everytime when someone calls for\n"
"    ``test`` the bot answers ``* bot tests.``\n"
"\n"
"    If you want the factoid to have random answers say (for example):\n"
"    ``@fruit is <reply> (orange|apple|banana)``. So when ``@fruit`` is called\n"
"    the bot will reply with one of the listed fruits (random): ``orange``.\n"

"    ``@no Hi is <reply> Hey`` when you call ``@hi`` the bot says ``Hey``.\n"
"\n"
"    If you want to append to the current value of a factoid say:\n"
"    ``@Hi is also Hello``, so that when you call ``@hi`` the\n"
"    bot says ``Hey, or Hello.`` \n"
