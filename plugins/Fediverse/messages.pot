"    Enabling Secure Fetch\n"
"    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n"
"\n"
"    The default configuration works with most ActivityPub servers, but not\n"
"    all of them, because they require an HTTP Signature to fetch profiles\n"
"    and statuses.\n"
"\n"
"    Because of how HTTP Signatures work, you need to add some configuration\n"
"    for Limnoria to support it.\n"
"\n"
"    First, you should set ``supybot.servers.http.port`` to a port you want\n"
"    your bot to listen on (by default it's 8080). If there are already\n"
"    plugins using it (eg. if Fediverse is already running), you should\n"
"    either unload all of them and load them back, or restart your bot.\n"
"\n"
"    Then, you must configure a reverse-proxy in front of your bot (eg. nginx),\n"
"    and it must support HTTPS.\n"
"\n"
"    Finally, set ``supybot.servers.http.publicUrl`` to the public URL of this\n"
"    server (when opening this URL in your browser, it should show a page with\n"
"    a title like \"Supybot web server index\").\n"
