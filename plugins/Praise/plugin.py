    Praise is a plugin for ... well, praising things.  Feel free to add
    your own flavor to it by customizing what praises it gives.  Use "praise
    add <text>" to add new ones, making sure to include "$who" in <text> where
    you want to insert the thing being praised.

    Example:

    * If you add ``hugs $who``
    * Someone says ``@praise ChanServ``.
    * ``* bot hugs ChanServ``

    Configuration variables in ``supybot.databases.plugins`` affect this plugin.
