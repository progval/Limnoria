This will increase or decrease karma for the item.

If "config plugins.karma.allowUnaddressedKarma" is set to true, saying "boats++" will give 1 karma to "boats", and "ships--" will subtract 1 karma from "ships".

However, if you use this in a sentence, like "That deserves a ++. Kevin++", 1 karma will be added to "That deserves a ++. Kevin", so you should only add or subtract karma in a line that doesn't have anything else in it.

If "config plugins.karma.allowUnaddressedKarma" is set to false, you must use "botname: bots++" to add or subtract karma.
