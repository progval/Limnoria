.. _plugin-Filter:

Documentation for the Filter plugin for Supybot
===============================================

Purpose
-------

Provides numerous filters, and a command (outfilter) to set them as filters on
the output of the bot.
For instance, you could make everything the bot says be
in leetspeak, or Morse code, or any number of other kinds of filters.
Not very useful, but definitely quite fun :)

See also the :ref:`Format plugin <plugin-Format>` for format manipulation
commands.

Usage
-----

This plugin offers several commands which transform text in some way.
It also provides the capability of using such commands to 'filter' the
output of the bot -- for instance, you could make everything the bot says
be in leetspeak, or Morse code, or any number of other kinds of filters.
Not very useful, but definitely quite fun :)

  Returns <text> as GNU/RMS would say it.

.. _command-filter-hebrew:

``hebrew <text>``
  Removes all the vowels from <text>. (If you're curious why this is named 'hebrew' it's because I (jemfinch) thought of it in Hebrew class, and printed Hebrew often elides the vowels.)

``hexlify <text>``
  Returns a hexstring from the given string; a hexstring is a string composed of the hexadecimal value of each character in the string

.. _command-filter-jeffk:
