Documentation for the Dunno plugin for Supybot
==============================================

Purpose
-------

The Dunno module is used to spice up the reply when given an invalid command
with random 'I dunno'-like responses.  If you want something spicier than
'<x> is not a valid command'-like responses, use this plugin.
Like Success does for the  'The operation succeeded.' reply.

Usage
-----

This plugin was written initially to work with MoobotFactoids, the two
of them to provide a similar-to-moobot-and-blootbot interface for factoids.
Basically, it replaces the standard 'Error: <x> is not a valid command.'
messages with messages kept in a database, able to give more personable
responses.

``$command`` in the message will be replaced by the command's name.
