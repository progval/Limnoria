"    This plugin allows users to define aliases to commands and combinations\n"
"    of commands (via nesting).\n"
"\n"
"    Importing from Alias\n"
"    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n"
"\n"
"    Add an aka, Alias, which eases the transitioning to Aka from Alias.\n"
"\n"
"    First we will load Alias and Aka::\n"
"\n"
"        <jamessan> @load Alias\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"        <jamessan> @load Aka\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"\n"
"    Then we import the Alias database to Aka in case it exists and unload\n"
"    Alias::\n"
"\n"
"        <jamessan> @importaliasdatabase\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"        <jamessan> @unload Alias\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"\n"
"    And now we will finally add the Aka ``alias`` itself::\n"
"\n"
"        <jamessan> @aka add \"alias\" \"aka $1 $*\"\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"\n"
"    Now you can use Aka as you used Alias before.\n"
"\n"
"    Trout\n"
"    ^^^^^\n"
"\n"
"    Add an aka, ``trout``, which expects a word as an argument::\n"
"\n"
"        <jamessan> @aka add trout \"reply action slaps $1 with a large trout\"\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"        <jamessan> @trout me\n"
"        * bot slaps me with a large trout\n"
"\n"
"    This ``trout`` aka requires the plugin ``Reply`` to be loaded since it\n"
"    provides the ``action`` command.\n"
"\n"
"    Random percentage\n"
"    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n"
"\n"
"    Add an aka, ``randpercent``, which returns a random percentage value::\n"
"\n"
"        @aka add randpercent \"squish [dice 1d100]%\"\n"
"\n"
"    This requires the ``Filter`` and ``Games`` plugins to be loaded.\n"
"\n"
"    Note that nested commands in an alias should be quoted, or they will only\n"
"    run once when you create the alias, and not each time the alias is\n"
"    called. (In this case, not quoting the nested command would mean that\n"
"    ``@randpercent`` always responds with the same value!)\n"
"    "
