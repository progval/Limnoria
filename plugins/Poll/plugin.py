    """Provides a simple way to vote on answers to a question

    For example, this creates a poll::

       <admin> @poll add "Is this a test?" "Yes" "No" "Maybe"
       <bot> The operation succeeded.  Poll # 42 created.

    Creates a poll that can be voted on in this way::

       <citizen1> @vote 42 Yes
       <citizen2> @vote 42 No
       <citizen3> @vote 42 No

    And results::

        <admin> @poll results
        <bot> 2 votes for No, 1 vote for Yes, and 0 votes for Maybe",

    Longer answers are possible, and voters only need to use the first
    word of each answer to vote. For example, this creates a poll that
    can be voted on in the same way::

       <admin> @poll add "Is this a test?" "Yes totally" "No no no" "Maybe"
       <bot> The operation succeeded.  Poll # 43 created.

    You can also add a number or letter at the beginning of each question to
    make it easier::

       <admin> @poll add "Who is the best captain?" "1 James T Kirk" "2 Jean-Luc Picard" "3 Benjamin Sisko" "4 Kathryn Janeway"
       <bot> The operation succeeded.  Poll # 44 created.

       <trekkie1> @vote 42 1
       <trekkie2> @vote 42 4
       <trekkie3> @vote 42 4
