.. _commands-Misc:

Commands
--------

.. _command-misc-apropos:

``apropos <string>``
  Searches for <string> in the commands currently offered by the bot, returning a list of the commands containing that string.

.. _command-misc-clearmores:

``clearmores takes no arguments``
  Clears all mores for the current network.

.. _command-misc-completenick:

``completenick [<channel>] <beginning> [--match-case]``
  Returns the nick of someone on the channel whose nick begins with the given <beginning>. <channel> defaults to the current channel.

.. _command-misc-help:

``help [<plugin>] [<command>]``
  This command gives a useful description of what <command> does. <plugin> is only necessary if the command is in more than one plugin. You may also want to use the 'list' command to list all available plugins and commands.

.. _command-misc-last:

``last [--{from,in,on,with,without,regexp} <value>] [--nolimit]``
  Returns the last message matching the given criteria. --from requires a nick from whom the message came; --in requires a channel the message was sent to; --on requires a network the message was sent on; --with requires some string that had to be in the message; --regexp requires a regular expression the message must match; --nolimit returns all the messages that can be found. By default, the channel this command is given in is searched.

.. _command-misc-list:

``list [--private] [--unloaded] [<plugin>]``
  Lists the commands available in the given plugin. If no plugin is given, lists the public plugins available. If --private is given, lists the private plugins. If --unloaded is given, it will list available plugins that are not loaded.

.. _command-misc-more:

``more [<nick>]``
  If the last command was truncated due to IRC message length limitations, returns the next chunk of the result of the last command. If <nick> is given, it takes the continuation of the last command from <nick> instead of the person sending this message.

.. _command-misc-noticetell:

``noticetell <nick> <text>``
  Tells the <nick> whatever <text> is, in a notice. Use nested commands to your benefit here.

  Checks to see if the bot is alive.

``source takes no arguments``
  Returns a URL saying where to get Limnoria.
