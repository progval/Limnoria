"    This plugin is useful both for announcing updates to RSS feeds in a\n"
"    channel, and for retrieving the headlines of RSS feeds via command.  Use\n"
"    the \"add\" command to add feeds to this plugin, and use the \"announce\"\n"
"    command to determine what feeds should be announced in a given channel.\n"
"\n"
"    Basic usage\n"
"    ^^^^^^^^^^^\n"
"\n"
"    1. Add a feed using\n"
"       ``@rss add limnoria https://github.com/progval/Limnoria/tags.atom``.\n"
"\n"
"       * This is RSS feed of Limnoria's stable releases.\n"
"       * You can now check the latest news from the feed with ``@limnoria``.\n"
"\n"
"    2. To have new news automatically announced on the channel, use\n"
"       ``@rss announce add Limnoria``.\n"
"\n"
"    To add another feed, simply replace limnoria and the address using name\n"
"    of the feed and address of the feed. For example, YLE News:\n"
"\n"
"    1. ``@rss add yle http://yle.fi/uutiset/rss/uutiset.rss?osasto=news``\n"
"    2. ``@rss announce add yle``\n"
"\n"
"    News on their own lines\n"
"    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n"
"\n"
"    If you want the feed topics to be on their own lines instead of being separated by\n"
"    the separator which you have configured you can set `reply.onetoone` to False.\n"
"\n"
"    Please first read the help for that configuration variable\n"
"\n"
"    ``@config help reply.onetoone``\n"
"\n"
"    and understand what it says and then you can do\n"
"\n"
"    ``@config reply.onetoone False``\n"
"\n"
"    "
