Documentation for the RSS plugin for Supybot
============================================

Purpose
-------

Provides basic functionality for handling RSS/RDF feeds, and allows announcing
them periodically to channels.
In order to use this plugin you must have `python3-feedparser
<https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/>`_ installed.

Usage
-----

This plugin is useful both for announcing updates to RSS feeds in a
channel, and for retrieving the headlines of RSS feeds via command.  Use
the "add" command to add feeds to this plugin, and use the "announce"
command to determine what feeds should be announced in a given channel.

Basic usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Add a feed using
   ``@rss add limnoria https://github.com/progval/Limnoria/tags.atom``.

   * This is RSS feed of Limnoria's stable releases.
   * You can now check the latest news from the feed with ``@limnoria``.

2. To have new news automatically announced on the channel, use
   ``@rss announce add Limnoria``.

To add another feed, simply replace limnoria and the address using name
of the feed and address of the feed. For example, YLE News:

1. ``@rss add yle http://yle.fi/uutiset/rss/uutiset.rss?osasto=news``
2. ``@rss announce add yle``

News on their own lines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want the feed topics to be on their own lines instead of being separated by
the separator which you have configured you can set `reply.onetoone` to False.

Please first read the help for that configuration variable

``@config help reply.onetoone``

and understand what it says and then you can do

``@config reply.onetoone False``
