"    This plugin allows users to act through the bot anonymously.  The 'do'\n"
"    command has the bot perform an anonymous action in a given channel, and\n"
"    the 'say' command allows other people to speak through the bot.  Since\n"
"    this can be fairly well abused, you might want to set\n"
"    supybot.plugins.Anonymous.requireCapability so only users with that\n"
"    capability can use this plugin.  For extra security, you can require that\n"
"    the user be *in* the channel they are trying to address anonymously with\n"
"    supybot.plugins.Anonymous.requirePresenceInChannel, or you can require\n"
"    that the user be registered by setting\n"
"    supybot.plugins.Anonymous.requireRegistration.\n"

"    Example: Proving that you are the owner\n"
"    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n"
"\n"
"    When you ask for cloak/vhost for your bot, the network operators will\n"
"    often ask you to prove that you own the bot. You can do this for example\n"
"    with the following method::\n"
"\n"
"        @load Anonymous\n"
"        @config plugins.anonymous.requirecapability owner\n"
"        @config plugins.anonymous.allowprivatetarget True\n"
"        @anonymous say <operator nick> Hi, my owner is <your nick> :)\n"
"\n"
"    This\n"
"    * Loads the plugin.\n"
"    * Makes the plugin require that you are the owner\n"
"\n"
"      * If anyone could send private messages as the bot, they could also\n"
"        access network services.\n"
"\n"
"    * Allows sending private messages\n"
"    * Sends message ``Hi, my owner is <your nick> :)`` to ``operator nick``.\n"
"\n"
"      * Note that you won't see the messages that are sent to the bot.\n"
