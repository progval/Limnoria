Documentation for the QuoteGrabs plugin for Supybot
===================================================

Purpose
-------

Quotegrabs are like IRC sound bites.  When someone says something funny,
incriminating, stupid, outrageous, ... anything that might be worth
remembering, you can grab that quote for that person.  With this plugin, you
can store many quotes per person and display their most recent quote, as well
as see who "grabbed" the quote in the first place.

Usage
-----

Stores and displays quotes from channels. Quotes are stored randomly
and/or on user request.
