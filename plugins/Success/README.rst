Documentation for the Success plugin for Supybot
================================================

Purpose
-------

The Success plugin spices up success replies by allowing custom messages
instead of the default 'The operation succeeded.' message;
like Dunno does for "no such command" replies.

Usage
-----

This plugin was written initially to work with MoobotFactoids, the two
of them to provide a similar-to-moobot-and-blootbot interface for factoids.
Basically, it replaces the standard 'The operation succeeded.' messages
with messages kept in a database, able to give more personable
responses.
