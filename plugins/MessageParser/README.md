The MessageParser plugin allows you to set custom regexp triggers, which will trigger the bot to respond if they match anywhere in the message. This is useful for those cases when you want a bot response even when the bot was not explicitly addressed by name or prefix character.

An updated page of this plugin's documentation is located here: http://sourceforge.net/p/gribble/wiki/MessageParser_Plugin/
