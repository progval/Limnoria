"Provides authentication based on GPG keys.\n"
"\n"
"    First you must associate your GPG key with your Limnoria account. The gpg\n"
"    add command takes two arguments, key id and key server.\n"
"\n"
"    My key is 0x0C207F07B2F32B67 and it's on keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net\n"
"    so and now I add it to my bot::\n"
"\n"
"        <Mikaela> +gpg add 0x0C207F07B2F32B67 pool.sks-keyservers.net\n"
"        <Yvzabevn> 1 key imported, 0 unchanged, 0 not imported.\n"
"\n"
"    Now I can get token to sign so I can identify::\n"
"\n"
"        <Guest45020> +gpg gettoken\n"
"        <Yvzabevn> Your token is: {03640620-97ea-4fdf-b0c3-ce8fb62f2dc5}. Please sign it with your GPG key, paste it somewhere, and call the 'auth' command with the URL to the (raw) file containing the signature.\n"
"\n"
"    Then I follow the instructions and sign my token in terminal::\n"
"\n"
"        echo \"{03640620-97ea-4fdf-b0c3-ce8fb62f2dc5}\"|gpg --clearsign|curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us\n"
"\n"
"    Note that I sent the output to curl with flags to directly send the\n"
"    clearsigned content to sprunge.us pastebin. Curl should be installed on\n"
"    most of distributions and comes with msysgit. If you remove the curl part,\n"
"    you get the output to terminal and can pastebin it to any pastebin of\n"
"    your choice. Sprunge.us has only plain text and is easy so I used it in\n"
"    this example.\n"
"\n"
"    And last I give the bot link to the plain text signature::\n"
"\n"
"        <Guest45020> +gpg auth http://sprunge.us/DUdd\n"
"        <Yvzabevn> You are now authenticated as Mikaela.\n"
