.. _commands-Seen:

Commands
--------

.. _command-seen-any:

``any [<channel>] [--user <name>] [<nick>]``
  Returns the last time <nick> was seen and what <nick> was last seen doing. This includes any form of activity, instead of just PRIVMSGs. If <nick> isn't specified, returns the last activity seen in <channel>. If --user is specified, looks up name in the user database and returns the last time user was active in <channel>. <channel> is only necessary if the message isn't sent on the channel itself.

.. _command-seen-last:

``last [<channel>]``
  Returns the last thing said in <channel>. <channel> is only necessary if the message isn't sent in the channel itself.

.. _command-seen-seen:

``seen [<channel>] <nick>``
  Returns the last time <nick> was seen and what <nick> was last seen saying. <channel> is only necessary if the message isn't sent on the channel itself. <nick> may contain * as a wildcard.

.. _command-seen-since:

``since [<channel>] [<nick>]``
  Returns the messages since <nick> last left the channel. If <nick> is not given, it defaults to the nickname of the person calling the command.

.. _command-seen-user:

``user [<channel>] <name>``
  Returns the last time <name> was seen and what <name> was last seen saying. This looks up <name> in the user seen database, which means that it could be any nick recognized as user <name> that was seen. <channel> is only necessary if the message isn't sent in the channel itself.
